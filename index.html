            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Soo Yeon Ahn, but you can call me Soo (same pronunciation as Sue) and I use she/her pronouns.</p>
            <p> I worked as a software engineer intern at <a href="https://www.3ds.com/">Dassault Systèmes</a> and developed 3D products (July 2023 ~ January 2024) using C and C++.
    I am an avid learner who thrives to understand everything relative to make sure that I know what I do, especially when I program.
    I recently graduated from the <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign</a>, majoring in <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/">mathematics and computer science</a>. For more details regarding the curriculum of mathematics and computer science, please follow this <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/bs-mathematics-computer-science">link</a>.<br>
                Currently, I am looking for a full-time job so that I can contribute for technological innovations in computer science! I am <b>actively seeking for software engineering roles (on-site/hybrid)</b> and am open to relocate.</p>
            <p>Here is a link to my <a href="https://github.com/SooYeonAhn1/">github page</a> that you may be interested in.</p>

        <section class="about">
            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p>I think of myself as a multicultural individual as I spent my life in three different countries growing up: Korea, New Zealand, and America. Due to this multicultural background,
    I think of myself as a person who can easily blend-in in any environment and can communicate with people despite having different backgrounds. Personally, I think communication is more than just speaking/listening.
    Understanding the culture behind an individual is key to fluent communication and is why not only do I enjoy studying natural languages in my free time, but the culture as well.
    Currently, I speak Korean (native), English (native), Chinese (intermediate, HSK Level 4), and a little bit of Spanish.
    Also, as you can see from my major, I am a big fan of mathematics and the logic behind it. I spend my free time reading, working out at the gym, and studying languages (natural and programming).</p>
