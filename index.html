</h2>
<body>
    <p style="font-family:arial">Hello! My name is Soo Yeon Ahn, but you can call me Soo (same pronunciation as Sue) and I use she/her pronouns.
    <br>
    <br>
    I worked as a software engineer intern at <a href="https://www.3ds.com/">Dassault Syst√®mes</a> and developed 3D products (July 2023 ~ January 2024) using C and C++.
    I am an avid learner who thrives to understand everything relative to make sure that I know what I do, especially when I program.
    I am also a student at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign</a>, majoring in <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/">mathematics and computer science</a>. For more details regarding the curriculum of mathematics and computer science, please follow this <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/bs-mathematics-computer-science">link</a>.
    Currently, I am looking for a full-time job so that I can contribute for technological innovations in computer science! As I am in my final semester, I am <b>actively seeking for software engineering roles (on-site/hybrid)</b> and am open to relocate.
    <br>

    Here is a link to <a href="https://github.com/SooYeonAhn1/School-Project">class projects</a> that you may be interested in. I have done more interesting projects during my school years but it cannot be shared due to academic integrity.

    Feel free to email me if you have any questions about my past experience/projects!

    <p style="font-family:arial">About Myself</p>
</h2>
<body>
    <p style="font-family:arial">I think of myself as a multicultural individual as I spent my life in three different countries growing up: Korea, New Zealand, and America. Due to this multinatural background,
    I think of myself as a person who can easily blend-in in any environment and can communicate with people despite having different backgrounds. Personally, I think communication is more than just speaking/listening.
    Understanding the culture behind an individual is key to fluent communication and is why not only do I enjoy studying natural languages in my free time, but the culture as well.
    Currently, I speak Korean (native), English (native), Chinese (intermediate, HSK Level 4), and a little bit of Spanish.
    Also, as you can see from my major, I am a big fan of mathematics and the logic behind it. I spend my free time reading, working out at the gym, and studying languages (natural and programming).
